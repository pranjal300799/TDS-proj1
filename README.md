1.)I used GitHub API to pull information on users and repositories for Barcelona in my case and minimum 100 follower count. I checked rate limits to avoid hitting them, then saved the collected data as csv. Also cleaned it up for ease in analysis and presentation\n
2.)Majority of these devs in Barcelona do not like to work at a company.They like to do FREELANCE WORK which is quite opposite to our Indian tech scene in india where developers like to stick to companies may be due to job security.It could be that the devs in barcelona are trusted and get paid good also.\n
3.)Our indian developers need to leverage the power of open source and  build a good portfolio to gain trust of employers abroad so they can get paid well and help other indian devs realise that through good work they can earn more as well as enjoy the reputation which i know is possible in india but very hard .
